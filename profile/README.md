A social space that motivates to achieve!

### âš¡ About

An app in which a person can set a personal goal and stake ethers on it. If the goal is reached, he will return the stake, otherwise the ethers will be shared between people who have subscribed to this goal.

This solution will give person an external motivation not to lose money. He will be concerned about failed goals as non-transferable NFTs will be linked to his blockchain account.

Also with oracles there may be goals that can be verified by a smart contract. So we be able to create contests with a large number of users.
