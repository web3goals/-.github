## ✨ Problem to be solved

People often set ambitious goals for themselves, but over time their motivation decreases. For this reason, they get frustrated and stop going toward their dreams.

Because of this huge problem, our world is losing a lot of great ideas and projects that could make us all better.

We hope that with the power of Web3 we can cope with this and come to a brighter future together.
